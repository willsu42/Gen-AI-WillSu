CrewAI Multi-Agent Demo: Travel Planning System
================================================

This demonstrates CrewAI's task-based multi-agent orchestration by planning
a 5-day trip to Iceland. Each agent has specialized tools that return
structured travel data, which the LLM then uses to create recommendations.

Agents:
1. FlightAgent - Flight Specialist (researches flight options)
2. HotelAgent - Accommodation Specialist (finds hotels)
3. ItineraryAgent - Travel Planner (creates day-by-day itineraries)
4. BudgetAgent - Financial Advisor (analyzes total costs)

Configuration:
- Uses shared configuration from the root .env file
